# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

Reviewed all the homework vids. 
I was quite stuck this week, so I watched all the videos. Watched docker fundamentals by Adrian, installed docker and attempted to secure dependencies and failed. Played around in VS code as this weakness is hindering my next step phase. Practicing and reviewing js, so this week I fell behind, re-reviewing codes I have never used/practiced. The codes displayed in class video, are not showing up in my github. I asked, it was shown but I'm not seeing them in my repo. Tried to run docker but I got an error, can't be done virtual. Many roadblocks experienced but I'm continuing!
